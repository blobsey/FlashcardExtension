# FlashcardExtension

Simple browser extension that makes you learn while you doomscroll 


When the user (that's you!) accesses a distracting site, they have to review some flashcards. Each flashcard answered correctly grants a configurable amount of time to doomscroll; multiple flashcards can be answered at once for a longer grant.

Uses [FlashcardAPIv2](https://github.com/blobsey/FlashcardAPIv2) to fetch flashcards and provides a nice interface for reviewing them in your browser.
